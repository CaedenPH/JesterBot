## Can I self-host JesterBot?

We would rather prefer you not running a direct cloned instance of JesterBot. It would be a ton better to just [`Invite`](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?self.bot_id=828363172717133874&scope=bot&permissions=8589934591) the bot.The source here is only for educational purpose and to maintain transparency on how we collect, use your data and off-course on how JesterBot's primary features work. We also do not take any responsibility if the code malfunctions on your side.

If you decide to edit, compile or use this code in any way. Kindly respect the [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/CaedenPH/JesterBot/blob/main/LICENSE).

<!-- CONTRIBUTION -->

## How do I contribute?

If you are looking forward to contribute to the project, we welcome you with open arms. kindly open an issue first for discussion.
It's also a good option to join the [`Support Server`](https://discord.gg/2654CuU3ZU) and get into touch with any member of staff

There are also some easter eggs in the code, let's see if you can find some :wink:

## About
Coded in discord.py, JesterBot has easy to use commands and an always active developer this bot is reliable and stable. There is a fully functioning economy system with options to buy certain perks - such as customisable roles. JesterBot specialises in ease of access and certain commands - such as ^verify support this.

### verify
What verify does is it automatically creates a verify chanel and when users press on it will automattically give them permission to enter the guildunverified and verified, and makes it so you can only gain access to the server by typing verfiy in the verifychannel.

### GiveRoles
This can also be paired with the ^giveroles command. Giveroles gives everyone in the guild a certain role - so one can do ^giveroles @verified and it will give everyone in the server verified...There is also the contrast of this being ^removeroles verified, without the mention because pinging everyone in the server just to remove roles can be annoying.

### Prefix
Pinging the bot gives you the prefix that you chose (default is ^ but you can change your personal prefix with ^prefix [prefix] etc). If you say "Hey Jesterbot" jesterbot reacts with a thumbs up and a thumbs down. If you press the thumbsup it shows up with what your prefix is (just like @jesterbot).

### Credits
Make sure to type `^credits` to get the devs of JesterBot!
