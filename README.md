# JesterBot

## About
Coded in discord.py, JesterBot has easy to use commands and an always active developer this bot is reliable and stable. There is a fully functioning economy system with options to buy certain perks - such as customisable roles. JesterBot specialises in ease of access and certain commands - such as ^verify support this.

### verify
What verify does is it automatically creates a verify chanel and when users press on it will automattically give them permission to enter the guildunverified and verified, and makes it so you can only gain access to the server by typing verfiy in the verifychannel.

### GiveRoles
This can also be paired with the ^giveroles command. Giveroles gives everyone in the guild a certain role - so one can do ^giveroles @verified and it will give everyone in the server verified...There is also the contrast of this being ^removeroles verified, without the mention because pinging everyone in the server just to remove roles can be annoying.

### Prefix
Pinging the bot gives you the prefix that you chose (default is ^ but you can change your personal prefix with ^prefix [prefix] etc). If you say "Hey Jesterbot" jesterbot reacts with a thumbs up and a thumbs down. If you press the thumbsup it shows up with what your prefix is (just like @jesterbot).
