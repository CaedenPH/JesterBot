**Off-topic channels**

There are three off-topic channels:
• <#291284109232308226>
• <#463035241142026251>
• <#463035268514185226>

The channel names change every night at midnight UTC and are often fun meta references to jokes or conversations that happened on the server.

See our [off-topic etiquette](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/resources/guides/off-topic-etiquette/) page for more guidance on how the channels should be used.
