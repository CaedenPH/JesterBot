**Pasting large amounts of code**

If your code is too long to fit in a codeblock in discord, you can paste your code here:
https://paste.pythondiscord.com/

After pasting your code, **save** it by clicking the floppy disk icon in the top right, or by typing `ctrl + S`. After doing that, the URL should **change**. Copy the URL and post it here so others can see it.
