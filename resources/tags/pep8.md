**PEP 8** is the official style guide for Python. It includes comprehensive guidelines for code formatting, variable naming, and making your code easy to read. Professional Python developers are usually required to follow the guidelines, and will often use code-linters like flake8 to verify that the code they're writing complies with the style guide.
