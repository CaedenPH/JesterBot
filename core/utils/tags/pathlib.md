**Pathlib**

Python 3 comes with a new module named `Pathlib`. Since Python 3.6, `pathlib.Path` objects work nearly everywhere that `os.path` can be used, meaning you can integrate your new code directly into legacy code without having to rewrite anything. Pathlib makes working with paths way simpler than `os.path` does.

**Feature spotlight**:

• Normalizes file paths for all platforms automatically  
• Has glob-like utilites (eg. `Path.glob`, `Path.rglob`) for searching files  
• Can read and write files, and close them automatically  
• Convenient syntax, utilising the `/` operator (e.g. `Path('~') / 'Documents'`)  
• Can easily pick out components of a path (eg. name, parent, stem, suffix, anchor)  
• Supports method chaining  
• Move and delete files  
• And much more
